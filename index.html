            <img class="jumping-img" src="home-images/jumping.JPG" alt="jumping">
            <p>	I cannot define myself without talking about travels and photography, two passions that inspire me and are reflected in my projects. Culture in general and arts have always taken my attention since I was young, especially music, films and literature. The interdisciplinary nature of journalism convinced me to study this career in the University of Buenos Aires in my home country Argentina. With the bachelor already in my hands my other passion: travelling.</p>
             <p>So, without think it twice, I decided to put my professional career on hold, bought a one-way ticket to New Zealand and started the adventure of travel around the world anyway the wind blows. Living such amazing landscapes (nature and urban) next to incredible persons that became my friends, I felt the attraction of capturing these moments with a camera, awakening my passion for photography.</p> 
               <p> Many years and countries before, the wind bring me to Denmark where I decided to settle down for a while and complement my acquired skills by my self-learning with a formal study in Multimedia Design at the Zealand University. Today I can proudly show my portfolio with as content-creator and multimedia designer with skills in the range of video and image production; web design using languages as HTML, CSS and JavaScript; knowledge in graphic design and design thinking principles in order to control the whole creating process of a multimedia product.</p>
               <p> Don’t be shy and take a look around! I’d love to hear what you think about my work, positive and negative feedback is really important to keep improving every day so, hope to hear from you.</p>
            <p>Thanks for your time.</p>
